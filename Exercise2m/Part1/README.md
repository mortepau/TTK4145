# Mutex and Channel basics

### What is an atomic operation?
> Atomic operations in concurrent programming are program operations that run completely independent of any other processes

### What is a semaphore?
> A semaphore is a variable or struct which is used to control the access to a resource

### What is a mutex?
> A mutex is a flag that controls which one of the producer and the consumer that can access a resource

### What is the difference between a mutex and a binary semaphore?
> A mutex is a lock while a binary semaphore is a signaling mechanism

### What is a critical section?
> A critical section is a part of the concurrent program where a shared resource can be accessed by more than one process/thread

### What is the difference between race conditions and data races?
 > A race condition is a situation where the result of an operation depends on the timing of some operations, while a data race is a situation where two (or more) threads access the same shared resource at the same time
